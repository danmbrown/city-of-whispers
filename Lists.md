# Lists

## <a id="secrets"></a>Secrets
Every "secret" consists of a Tie (a person the character knows) and an area of insight -- what they know about that person. When using a secret about a person, it must relate to the area of insight.

## <a id="factions"></a>Factions
Every character belongs to a faction. The nature of that connection can be strong or tenuous. Regardless, the player decides the actions of that faction using [Faction Moves](Moves.md#Faction-Moves).

Factions are described with a Type, a Status, and a Complication. These descriptors influence the fiction, but have no mechanical bearing. Factions also have one or more Aspects that describe advantages or assets. These aspects may be used when rolling [Faction Moves](Moves.md#Faction-Moves).
