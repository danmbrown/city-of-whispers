# Lists
These tables give players and the Magistrate the tools for building the connective tissue of the city -- the factions that exert control, the neighborhoods that form the topography, and the rumors that fuel the entire contraption.

## <a id="backdrops"></a>Backdrops
To set up your campaign, it may be useful to identify a backdrop, a recent event or happening that frames the action and position of the city. 

Either before you create the city or afterward, roll a d8 three times, combining one word from each list. Discuss the resulting phrase and tease out what it means for your campaign.

If you've already created the city, go around the table and have each person suggest one change or addition based on the backdrop.

If you haven't yet created the city, as you add elements, have the Magistrate ask what effect the backdrop has on the element you add.

## Secrets
Every "secret" consists of a Tie (a person the character knows) and an area of insight -- what they know about that person. When using a secret about a person, it must relate to the area of insight.

## <a id="factions"></a>Factions
Every character belongs to a faction. The nature of that connection can be strong or tenuous. Regardless, the player decides the actions of that faction using [Faction Moves](Moves.md#Faction-Moves).

Factions are described with a Type, a Status, and a Complication. These descriptors influence the fiction, but have no mechanical bearing. Factions also have one or more Aspects that describe advantages or assets. These aspects may be used when rolling [Faction Moves](Moves.md#Faction-Moves).
