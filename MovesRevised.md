<a id="Social-Interaction-Moves"></a>
## Social Interaction Moves
Social Interaction Moves relate to a specific named individual. When characters interact with someone in particular, use Direct Someone to Act. When dealing with the denizens of the city more generally, use **Get Something**.

You may not mark Histories or City Demands to affect this roll, but you may indicate you want to **Use a Secret** before you roll.

### Direct Someone to Act
When you demand someone *provide information* they have access to or *take an action* they are capable of taking, describe what you're demanding and whether you're offering **peril**, **value**, or **logic**.

If you demand they act against their self-interest, or reveal something that betrays their interests, they partially comply, OR pick a **strong reaction**.

Otherwise, roll. NPCs will react to each offer type differently. The Magistrate will indicate whether you should roll with Sway, Heat, or flat (no modifier). If you must roll with Heat, roll minus the number of marked Heat.

On a hit, you pick a **weak reaction**. On 7-9, they pick a **consequence**.

#### Strong Reactions 
- They make counter-offer (Do you accept?)

- Diminish your standing in your faction


<a id="Secrets-Moves"></a>
## Secrets Moves

### Use a Secret
When you use secret knowledge in your social interactions, describe how you use the secret without revealing it, then roll with advantage. But if any of the dice show 1 or 2, then you **Reveal a Secret**.

> **Example of _Use a Secret_**
>
> Miabella is negotiating with the pirate Donatella for the secret location of the treasure under the city. Miabella offers to split the treasure with Donatella in exchange for the location. 
>
> Miabella knows the pirate Donatella has a secret forbidden love named Arvel. The player opts to use this knowledge to influence Donatella, implying that certain members of the elite, including Arvel, would appreciate uncovering this essential part of the city's history.
>
> The player rolls three dice and gets a 1 + 4 + 5. This gives Miabella a 9 on the **Direct Someone to Act** move, but the secret is revealed. According to the **Reveal a Secret** move, Miabella loses the Tie with Donatella.
>
> The Magistrate gets to pick two Reactions for Donatella. From Negotiate, Donatella selects *Demand more compensation* and from  Reveal a Secret, Donatella selects *They deny the truth, leaving you in doubt*.
> 
> Says Donatella, "You think you know so much. My love for Arvel is long buried. I will tell you the location, but for your impudence, we will split the treasure 70-30."

### Reveal a Secret
When you reveal a secret to someone, mark Heat. If the secret is about the person you're talking to, **mark the secret** and **lose the Tie** with them. 

- With a Social Interaction Move, resolve the original move, but they may pick one additional Reaction from the list below.

## Risky Moves
### Use Power
When you tap into your connection to magic, technology, or other mysterious power, describe what you hope to accomplish. The Magistrate will assign a **complexity**. If the complexity is equal to or less than your max, roll normally. If it is above your max, roll with disadvantage. You may take +1 if you have a connection to the neighborhood or -2 if you do not.

- **12+** You achieve your goal flawlessly.
- **10+** Pick 1 Consequence.
- **7-9** Pick 2 Consequences OR the power **backfires**.

#### Consequences
- Lesser effect (in area, duration, scale, or intensity)

- The power has an unexpected cost

### Backfire (lower is better)

- Implicate your faction: How does this connect to them?

### Take a Big Risk
When you do something dangerous, felonious, violent, or imprudent describe the what you fear might happen, mark Heat and roll + most relevant attribute. Outcomes should align with the fiction. You probably can’t defeat a trained warrior in one-on-one combat even if you roll a **10+**.

- **12+** You succeed in what you set out to do, and you may pick a second outcome from the consequences list below or clear 1 Heat.
- **10+** You succeed in what you set out to do. You may mark Heat to pick another outcome from the consequences list below.

## Faction Moves

### Secure Resource
To acquire resources, including materials, expertise, and personnel, a faction may make use of its existing aspects so long as they’re relevant to the acquisition. If the faction is operating in a neighborhood it controls, it may include the neighborhood as an aspect when rolling.

If there is no dominant faction when another faction moves in to take control, the encroaching faction becomes dominant.
