# Introduction
*You found a place to live? You know a good market to get food, yeah? Got a job? Between gigs? Ah, you’re practically homegrown, then. This city is home to hundreds of thousands of people. Our city – now your city – is the biggest stewpot in the world. If folk leave their place, they come here. That’s just how it is. You can walk down any street and hear ten different languages. In one neighborhood, every other storefront is a noodle shop run by someone from the southern countries. Turn the corner, now the air is thick with smells of the spiced meat of the northern nomads. This city is the crossroads of every culture in the world. If you can’t get it here, it don’t exist.*

*But hey – and I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this – in this city, you’re no one special. At least, no more special than anyone else. Even if you are one in ten thousand, there’s at least a dozen other people just like you. But hey, there’s something to be said for anonymity, for a certain amount of blending in. You don’t make any waves, you can make serious coin in this town. You lay low, there’s nobody telling you what to do. You can stick to the shadows between the streetlamps, that’s way better than everyone up in your business.*

*But if you want fame and notoriety, if you want to make your mark and get credit for it, that’s another story. It can be done. Sure. You’ve heard of Rolnar the Undaunted? Kisra Ptozlon, the Duchess of the Fourth Ward? Lord Wizard Jurlyn? You think they were born into renown and power? You think they showed up one day with their name on everyone’s lips? They worked at that. They paid their dues. You want to make a mark on this city, you can’t just sit back and wait for the opportunity to come to you. There’s ten other people waiting to grab it. You got to go grab it first.*

## Overview
City of Whispers marries my love of fantasy settings with my love of life in cities. Most fantasy games describe epic adventures, with characters embarking on a journey across harsh landscapes. Their stops in urban areas are brief -- to stock up on supplies, enjoy the city's amenities, and perhaps scrape up some information -- before heading back into the wild. 

But the city is home to thousands of interesting stories, too. The tales aren't epic, but street-level. The risks aren't to life and limb, but (perhaps more deadly) political. The central conceit isn't adventure, but intrigue. At the same time, the city boasts diversity and innovation. In the city, the characters will experience not a band of goblins protecting treasure, but a goblin merchan
