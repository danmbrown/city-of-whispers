# Introduction
*You found a place to live? You know a good market to get food, yeah? Got a job? Between gigs? Ah, you’re practically homegrown, then. This city is home to hundreds of thousands of people. Our city – now your city – is the biggest stewpot in the world. If folk leave their place, they come here. That’s just how it is. You can walk down any street and hear ten different languages. In one neighborhood, every other storefront is a noodle shop run by someone from the southern countries. Turn the corner, now the air is thick with smells of the spiced meat of the northern nomads. This city is the crossroads of every culture in the world. If you can’t get it here, it don’t exist.*

*But hey – and I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this – in this city, you’re no one special. At least, no more special than anyone else. Even if you are one in ten thousand, there’s at least a dozen other people just like you. But hey, there’s something to be said for anonymity, for a certain amount of blending in. You don’t make any waves, you can make serious coin in this town. You lay low, there’s nobody telling you what to do. You can stick to the shadows between the streetlamps, that’s way better than everyone up in your business.*

*But if you want fame and notoriety, if you want to make your mark and get credit for it, that’s another story. It can be done. Sure. You’ve heard of Rolnar the Undaunted? Kisra Ptozlon, the Duchess of the Fourth Ward? Lord Wizard Jurlyn? You think they were born into renown and power? You think they showed up one day with their name on everyone’s lips? They worked at that. They paid their dues. You want to make a mark on this city, you can’t just sit back and wait for the opportunity to come to you. There’s ten other people waiting to grab it. You got to go grab it first.*

## Overview
City of Whispers marries my love of fantasy settings with my love of life in cities. Most fantasy games describe epic adventures, with characters embarking on a journey across harsh landscapes. Their stops in urban areas are brief -- to stock up on supplies, enjoy the city's amenities, and perhaps scrape up some information -- before heading back into the wild. 

But the city is home to thousands of interesting stories, too. The tales aren't epic, but street-level. The risks aren't to life and limb, but (perhaps more deadly) political. The central conceit isn't adventure, but intrigue. The characters get wrapped up in schemes, some of their own making. And inevitably, they find themselves embroiled in some of the city's most nefarious conspiracies.

At the same time, the city boasts diversity and innovation. In the city, the characters will experience not a band of goblins protecting treasure, but a goblin cab driver haggling the price of a cross-town trip. 

## What the players do
In City of Whispers, players assume the role of denizens in a large fantasy city. As city-dwellers they have access to a wide variety of people and resources typical in an urban environment. Likewise, they also have limited command over a source of power -- the mystic arts, arcane technology, divine connection, and others. Finally, the characters know secrets about other people in the city -- some with great power or knowledge, and some with access. Despite these advantages, characters are not immune to the city's needs. And though they may not start out embroiled in any particular plot or scheme, the conspiracies of the city waste no time sinking their tendrils into the characters.

At the outset, characters are defined by their relationship to the city. Each playbook represents a different aspect of city living, from facilitating connections between people to providing crucial resources. In addition, through play the players define the various connections characters have to the city itself: where the character first fell in love, where they learned a life lesson, or where the city kept them safe. 

Through the stories of their characters, the players also flesh out the city itself, establishing its geographic contours, its political and social landscape, and its history and lore. 

## Defining city, fantasy, and intrigue
City of Whispers asks players to lean into tropes across the three main aspects of the game: city, fantasy, and intrigue.

### City
* Sprawling urban area, with layers of buildings and architectural features, hidden corners
* Vast diversity, as cities attract folk from all over the land
* And, as a consequence of diversity, cities allow for intersecting cultures
* Which makes them a hub of innovation and creativity
* Each neighborhood has a distinct feel, to the point where denizens of a neighborhood demonstrate provincial loyalty

### Fantasy
* Humanoids and creatures of all types inhabit the world
* Magic and sorcery and arcane technology abound, but are not well-understood by most people
* Making use of these powers is dangerous, and can have serious consequences

### Intrigue
* Cities are home to schemes, plots, and conspiracies, driven by various factions and groups
* The characters find themselves enmeshed in (or the architects of) these schemes, and often in over their heads
* The characters know things about other people in the city
* Using those secrets can give the characters a powerful advantage, but can also backfire

## Player responsibilities
- **Embody your character**. Your character is complex, with competing needs and desires. They have relationships to other people, which puts pressure on them. They try to live according to their values, but often act according to their motives.
- **Interact with the city**. But your character doesn't exist outside their environment. Allow them to embrace all the city has to offer, to indulge in the amenities, and take advantage of the opportunities. Show the others how intimately your character knows their part of the city.
- **Clarify your boundaries**. Tell the other players what topics are off-limits. Give yourself permission to step away from the game. Speak up in the moment or later when a part of the narrative doesn't sit well with you. You are co-author of this story, so it must be something you, too, will enjoy.
- **Respect other players** While the two previous points are important to the game, ultimately you must interact with the other players at the table. Your character may skirt the fringes of antisocial behavior, but you may not.
