### Use a Secret
When you do not roll as well as you would like and you use a secret to gain the edge, ask the Magistrate what will happen if you reveal it. (The Magistrate may choose from the list in **Reveal A Secret** or one of the Strong Responses in the move.) Say what sacrifice you're willing to make to keep it. Then, pick up one of the dice you rolled, add another die and re-roll. If the new die is highest, make your sacrifice. Otherwise, the secret is revealed. Use the two highest values for your move.

> #### Example of "Use a Secret"
> Miabella is negotiating with the pirate Donatella for the secret location of the treasure under the city. Miabella offers to split the treasure with Donatella in exchange for the location. Miabella (Influence 0) rolls a 2 and a 4. Miabella knows the pirate Donatella has a secret love. The player says she might use this secret to suggest Donatella's love would appreciate the influx of cash. The Magistrate says that Miabella senses that revealing she knows Donatella's love will cause the pirate to attack. The player says that in lieu of revealing the secret, Miabella will give up any treasure she finds in the expedition. 
> 
> The player re-rolls the die showing 2 to get a 3 and rolls a new die, which shows a 5. The secret remains safe. Miabella uses 9 (4 from previous roll + 5 from new roll) for the Negotiate move and must sacrifice any treasure recovered on the expedition. Given the 7-9 result, Donatella would also select one of the Strong Responses for Negotiate. 
> 
> If the player had rolled a 5 with the first die and a 2 with the new die, Miabella would have a 9 for the Negotiate move, but will have revealed the secret. Donatella would attack. One way to resolve this is that Donatella uses violence to reinforce her power over Miabella, and reveals the location expecting Miabella to bring all the treasure to her.




#### Informants
You have a network of people who provide useful information on the goings on of the city. When you use a move that gains information (Appraise Circumstances, Get Something, or Observe Someone) you may mark your Informants as if marking a History or Demand. When you do, describe the informant and increase your result by one tier. Every time you mark an Informant, roll -Informants marked. On a hit, you don't raise any suspicion. On a 10+, you may clear one mark. You may reset the informants marks by spending one resource. 


### Apply Pressure
When you threaten someone to get them to violate their duty, responsibility, or norms, name your request and your threat or leverage.

If they have a clear reason to think your threat is not credible, they may choose to go along with you or not. They may also pick a consequence.

Otherwise, they think you *might* pose a threat: roll +Influence.

On a hit, they do believe you pose a credible threat:

- If they face a credible threat from another party as well, they pick a **strong reaction** and a **consequence**.
- Otherwise:

**10+** They pick a weak reaction and a consequence
**7 - 9** They pick a strong reaction and a consequence

#### Strong Reactions 
How they respond to your threat
-   Make counter-offer (Do you accept?)
-   Make counter-threat (Is their threat credible?)
-   Demand proof of threat (Do you follow through?)
-   Demand something of value (Do you give it to them?)
-   Comply, but partially or maliciously

If you meet any counter or demand, they comply.

#### Weak Reactions 
How they respond to your threat
-   Comply with request
-   Buy time
-   Demand being left alone
-   Request time or resources to comply
-   Attempt escape

#### Consequences 
How they will act long-term

-   None
-   Intend revenge or betrayal
-   Disappear
-   Spread rumor
-   Threaten harm
-   Remain loyal to a fault

### Negotiate
When you offer something of value in exchange for something important, name your request and your offer.

If they have any reason not to comply or find value in your offer, they pick a strong reaction.

Otherwise, roll +Influence. On a hit, they find your offer enticing.

- **10+** They pick a weak reaction.
- **7 - 9** They pick a strong reaction.

#### Strong Reaction
-   Demand more compensation
-   Demand alternative compensation
-   Also demand a favor from you
-   Offer something less important

#### Weak Reaction
-   Accept offer
-   Demand explanation
-   Demand time or resources to comply
-   Offer something less important without compensation


### Convince or Provoke or Request
When you plead with someone to act by changing their mind using wit or reason or passion, name your request and explain your perspective.

If they fear reprisal or cost for acting, you may Apply Pressure or Negotiate, or roll Convince/Provoke at a disadvantage.

Otherwise, roll +Influence. On a hit they acknowledge your perspective or are moved by your words.

- **10+** They are convinced; they pick a Reaction.
- **7 - 9** They are merely intrigued; they pick one Reaction and one Consequence.

#### Reactions
-   Act until it costs them, hurts them, or they get a better offer
-   Avoid acting, but give up another piece of information
-   Demand resources or compensation (money, favor, etc.) to act
-   Demand someone trustworthy vouch for you
-   Demand ensuring their safety
-   Avoid acting, but offer to stick around till itâ€™s done
-   Change the terms of the request
-   Comply but in a diminished, indirect, or malicious way (holding something back)

#### Consequences
- Ask why
- Remain suspicious or skeptical of you
- Demand to be left alone
- Reveal your intentions or actions to someone else
- Change your reputation with them
- Become a loyal follower, perhaps to a fault
