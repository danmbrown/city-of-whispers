## New Play Test Sessions
With November comes a new round of play test sessions. One of the players played an earlier version of the game, so it'll be interesting for them to experience the significant updates to it. 

Some experiments I'm running:

1. I usually save faction creation for 3-4 sessions in, to let the "street-level" story take shape. In this game we've done faction creation in our session 0 and made some initial faction moves in session 1.
2. Since the [Crossroads] and [Remnant] playbooks have gotten so much testing, I took them off the table.
3. In a previous play test, the players expressed some concern about how close all the character relationships were. I updated character creation to ask about other characters' connections, rather than the characters themselves. The intent is that the relationships between player characters are mediated by connections / non-player characters. (See next entry)

## Updates to Relationships
In this round of testing, I used relationship questions that ask the players about their characters' connections, not the characters themselves. The intent here is that NPCs serve as fictionally interesting intersections between the characters.
