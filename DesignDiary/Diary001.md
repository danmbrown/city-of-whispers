## Neighborhood Connections

City of Whispers was born Summer 2020, when I wrote the first draft of a PbtA game that emphasized the characters' relationships with the city. My aim was to have those relationships woven into the fabric of the game. In that version of the game, the relationship came from shared tags. If a character and a neighborhood shared a tag, the player could buff their rolls. 

Although the rules have evolved considerably since then this aspect remains. Evaluating tags to see what's shared proved too cumbersome. Instead, players name the neighborhoods their characters have connections with. Additionally, there are mechanisms throughout the game where they can form new connections. Performing any City Move in a neighborhood where the character has a connection, the player can roll with advantage.

I'm largely happy with how this has been working in our play tests, but players sometimes forget their neighborhood connection. In running the game, I've also neglected to give characters a neighborhood connection at the outset.

>In the next play test, during Session 0 we'll make sure to define home neighborhoods and establish connections to them.
