`This move is just too complicated...`

### Direct Someone to Act
When you demand someone *provide information* they have access to or *take an action* they are capable of taking, describe what you're demanding and whether you're offering **peril**, **value**, or **logic**.

If you demand they act against their self-interest, or reveal something that betrays their interests, they partially comply, OR pick a **strong reaction**.

Otherwise, roll. NPCs will react to each offer type differently. The Magistrate will indicate whether you should roll with Sway, Heat, or flat (no modifier). If you must roll with Heat, roll minus the number of marked Heat.

On a hit, you pick a **weak reaction**. On 7-9, they pick a **consequence**.

#### Strong Reactions 
- They make counter-offer (Do you accept?)
- They demand proof of your offer (Do you follow through?)
- They demand something of greater value (Do you give it to them?)
- They demand a favor (Do you agree?)

If you meet any counter or demand, they comply.

#### Weak Reactions
- They comply with your request and pick a Consequence
- They request resources or compensation (money, favor, etc.) or credential to comply
- They request ensuring their safety
- They comply but in a diminished, indirect, or malicious way (holding something back)
- They cannot comply with your request but offer something less important
- (If directed to act) They comply with your request until it costs them, hurts them, or they get a better offer

#### Consequences
- Reveal your intentions or actions to someone else
- Become a loyal follower, perhaps to a fault
- Intend revenge or betrayal
- Disappear
- Spread a rumor about you
- Diminish your standing in your faction


`Does this sufficently encompass situations that are not physically harmful?`

### Take a Big Risk
When you risk physical harm, break the law, or make a scene describe your objective and what you're prepared to give up to succeed, mark Heat and roll + most relevant attribute. Outcomes should align with the fiction. You probably canâ€™t defeat a trained warrior in one-on-one combat even if you roll a **10+**.

- **12+** You succeed in what you set out to do. Pick an additional outcome from the list below or clear 1 Heat.
- **10+** You succeed in what you set out to do. You may mark Heat to pick an additional outcome from the list below.
- **7 - 9** You succeed but the Magistrate will tell you the cost; Or the magistrate will offer you a hard choice.

#### Additional Outcomes
- **Knowledge**: Learn something about someone or something, or someone learns something about you
- **Attention**: Attract attention or remain hidden
- **Harm**: Avoid harm or cause an opponent temporary harm
- **Reputation**: Word gets around about you
- **Acquisition**: Gain something from someone


`New idea for a move`

### Make a Scene
When you speak out or act out in a public place, describe what you say and do, and roll with Sway.

On a hit, pick 1. On a 10+ pick another.

- No one escalates the situation
- No one retaliates against you
- No one summons the authorities
- There's no blowback to your faction

If any PCs are present, and
- one of their beliefs is challenged, they may clear one Heat if they mark it (if already marked, they are convinced the belief is wrong).
- OR they are swayed by your deeds, they may add a marked belief based on what you said or did.
