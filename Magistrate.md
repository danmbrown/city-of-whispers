# Magistrate's Agenda, Principles, and Moves
## Agenda
### Portray a bustling, diverse, cosmopolitan metropolis
There's always something going on in the city. Cities are a bastion of innovation, creativity, and action. It's in cities that we come to understand that everyone is the main character in their own story. The players should feel like there's something happening around every corner. They should glimpse only a small percentage of the things happening in the city, and understand that the most interesting things happening have nothing to do with them.

### Fill the charactersâ€™ lives with schemes and intrigue
Living in a city means living cheek-by-jowl with your neighbors. They can't help but insinuate themselves into each others' lives. And everyone has an agenda or an angle. The characters should perceive that every person they meet has something going on on the side. Every person knows something about someone else. Every person can offer the characters the opportunity of a lifetime, if they can do them a favor.

### Play to find out what happens
While it's helpful to come to the table with some ideas of plot hooks, adversaries, locations, and supporting characters, let the story unfold on its own. Don't make any assumptions about how the story ends, or even how it middles. As the Magistrate, be prepared to set the stakes, inject dramatic twists, and generally challenge characters in their efforts to meet their goals.


## Principles
### Embrace the urban and the cosmopolitan
Living in a city is different from exploring a dungeon or wandering the wilderness. The mystery isn't so much about what lies beyond the next corner, but more about how so-and-so might stab you in the back. At the same time, the city is its own source of wonder and delight. This city is at the center of your world, boasting a near endless variety of cultures and peoples.

### Imply machinations behind the scenes
Every person the characters meet has more going on than meets the eye. They have schemes and dealings. They have connections and opportunities. The people the characters meet may be involved in the characters' stories, but they're not the main characters: this is not the most important thing in their world at the moment. They have someone else putting pressure on them. They have a meeting they need to get to. They have their wealth tied up in some bigger risk.

### Test their connection to the city


### Address the characters, not the players
### Make a move that follows
### Never speak the name of your move
### Give every character a routine
### Name every person
### Ask questions and use the answers
### Be a fan of the characters
### Think dangerous
### Begin and end with the fiction
### Think offscreen, too
