# Magistrate's Agenda, Principles, and Moves
## Agenda
### Portray a bustling, diverse, cosmopolitan metropolis
There's always something going on in the city. Cities are a bastion of innovation, creativity, and action. It's in cities that we come to understand that everyone is the main character in their own story. The players should feel like there's something happening around every corner. They should glimpse only a small percentage of the things happening in the city, and understand that the most interesting things happening have nothing to do with them.

### Fill the charactersâ€™ lives with schemes and intrigue
Living in a city means living cheek-by-jowl with your neighbors. They can't help but insinuate themselves into each others' lives. And everyone has an agenda or an angle. The characters should perceive that every person they meet has something going on on the side. Every person knows something about someone else. Every person can offer the characters the opportunity of a lifetime, if they can do them a favor.

### Play to find out what happens
While it's helpful to come to the table with some ideas of plot hooks, adversaries, locations, and supporting characters, let the story unfold on its own. Don't make any assumptions about how the story ends, or even how it middles. As the Magistrate, be prepared to set the stakes, inject dramatic twists, and generally challenge characters in their efforts to meet their goals.


## Principles
### Embrace the urban and the cosmopolitan
Living in a city is different from exploring a dungeon or wandering the wilderness. The mystery isn't so much about what lies beyond the next corner, but more about how so-and-so might stab you in the back. At the same time, the city is its own source of wonder and delight. This city is at the center of this world, boasting a near endless variety of cultures and peoples. As Magistrate, you have license to 

### Embrace the fantastic and the wondrous
The city is crawling with fantastic creatures -- cultured humanoids of all sizes, domesticated beasts, and vermin. People and beasts and creatures brought together in a city behave very differently than they do in the jungles and forests and wastelands. Moreover, the city is infused with magic and arcane technologies, likely of several different types. As the Magistrate, you have license to bring these elements to life, to craft visions of a city that fuses our modern understanding of urban environments with the best speculative fiction has to offer.

### Imply machinations behind the scenes
Every person the characters meet has more going on than meets the eye. They have schemes and dealings. They have connections and opportunities. The people the characters meet may be involved in the characters' stories, but they're not the main characters: this is not the most important thing in their world at the moment. They have someone else putting pressure on them. They have a meeting they need to get to. They have their wealth tied up in some bigger risk.

### Test their connection to the city


### Address the characters, not the players
### Make a move that follows
### Never speak the name of your move
### Give every character a routine
### Name every person
### Ask questions and use the answers
### Be a fan of the characters
### Think dangerous
### Begin and end with the fiction
### Think offscreen, too


## Moves
### Turn up the Heat
Heat is the currency representing bad things happening to the character. The more Heat they're under, they more they are under the scrutiny of the city's resident powers.

### Reveal a rival or a Tie
People show up at the most inopportune times. Nothing shakes up a situation more than a person appearing on the scene. 

### Disrupt someone's routine
### Put them in conflict with their faction
### Have the city betray them
Knowledge of the city can be more powerful than knowing magic. But the city serves no one but itself. Just when a character thinks they can be too clever, when they think their intimacy with the city will get them out of a jam is just when the city reveals it has other plans.

### Make offers they can't refuse
### Take them to a new neighborhood
### Reveal a mysterious aspect of the city
### Issue a request from an unlikely place
### Reveal unwanted attention from the public, a rival faction, or a powerful person
### Reveal an unwelcome truth
### Turn their move back on them
### Separate them
### Give an opportunity that fits their abilities
### Show a downside to their connection to the city
### Offer an opportunity, with or without cost
### Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask
