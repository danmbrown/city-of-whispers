# Skyline
## The Watcher
Favored Attribute: Network

>*The city is a great chessboard, an ever-shifting flow of moves and counter-moves: strategem, maneuvers, and gambits. It would be easy to lose track of everything going on, but not for you.*


## Moves

### Always Prepared 
*(Improvement to Get Something)*

You have a 4-segment clock called Prep. When you **Get Something**, you may mark this clock instead of Heat. You can reset this clock with your Recuperate trigger.

### See the Connections 
*(Improvement to Observe Someone)*

When you **Observe Someone**, you may ask "Who are they connected to?" regardless of what you roll.

### An Eye on the Machine 
*(Alternate Attribute)*

When you put your **Ear to the Ground** you may roll with Network.

### The Big Picture
When you **Get Your Bearings** you may always ask "How does this neighborhood connect to ____________?" regardless of the other questions you ask.

### Well-Placed Connection
You know someone in a high place among the local authorities. Your starting Favor with that person is -1. Whenever you like, but no more than once per session, roll with Favor. You may spend an Asset to roll with +1. On a hit, hold 1. On 7-9, reduce Favor by one.

Spend hold 1-for-1 to:
- Increase Favor by 1 
- Add an aspect to any neighborhood
- Clear 1 Heat
- Add a Tie with an Insight related to the well-placed connection

If Favor reaches -3, the well-placed connection demands something in return for maintaining the alliance. Something big.

### 
When you **Use Power** to protect yourself, roll with +2.

## Ties & Secrets
Pick two people with whom you have a Tie. For each, pick what you know about them from the [[Lists#Area of Insight]]
- Derrin, your sibling
- Balti, a colleague
- Drugh, a dealer at a gambling den
- Ozhyr, a messenger
- Ivedro, a mentor
 
## Recuperation
- When you recognize the relationship between two unrelated entities -- people or factions -- clear two heat.
