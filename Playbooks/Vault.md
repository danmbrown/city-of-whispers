# Vault
## The Patron
Favored Attribute: Network

>*The city hums with activity, but without your patronage, it would come to a screeching halt.*

## Map Elements
In your first session, add an element to the map that represents the city's wealth or former glory. Here are some ideas:

- A monument to the city's (former) renown
- A major financial institution, caught in a scandal
- A club frequented by the aristocracy
- A formerly wealthy neighborhood in transition
- A rival's business or residence

At any time, you may mark Heat to add another element to the map.

## Moves
### Wealth and Influence (Required)
Start every session with one Asset marked. If you already have an Asset marked, you may instead clear one Heat.

### Follow the Money
*(Improvement to Appraise)*

Whenever you **Appraise Circumstances** you may always ask one of these questions:

- Who here has the most wealth or power?
- How would a well-placed bribe or pay-off change the situation?
-  Who here is most susceptible to my influence?

### Grease the Palms
*(Improvement to Get Something)*

When you **Get Something**, you may spend an Asset in lieu of taking a Consequence.

### Inner Circle (Group)
You belong to a group of the city's elite. You have a track of three boxes called **Privilege**. You may mark a box to bump the result of a role one tier. When you do, roll -Privilege. On a miss, pick one Consequence and mark it off. On a 10+, erase a mark of Consequence.
- You learned a secret about someone else in the inner circle. Ask the GM who and what about.
- You kicked up some dust; Mark Heat.
- You are ejected from the inner circle. Cross off this move and pick two from this playbook or one from another.


### Notorious Influence
You have spent years paying off the right people, lining pockets wherever you go. 


### Private Transportation
You have a special mode of transportation designed to get around the city most effectively. When you **Transit**, if you use it, you may roll with Network instead of Environs.

### Keen Eye
When you **Use Power** to gauge distance, volume, value, or other quantity, roll with +2.


## Ties & Secrets
Pick two people with whom you have a Tie. For each, pick what you know about them from the [[Lists#Area of Insight]]
- Tharrami, an artist you funded
- Halamar, a cousin who is down and out on their luck
- Eldruin, a parent who doesn't understand you
- Urzul, a former employee who is now successful themselves
- Shel, a former lover who still has a piece of your heart

## Recuperation
- You may always clear 1 Heat when you lay low for a day. Ask the Magistrate what you missed.
- When you can make use of your wealth without attracting attention, clear 1 Heat.
- When you share an intimate moment with someone and they see you as someone separate from your resources or wealth, clear 1 heat.
