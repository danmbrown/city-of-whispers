# Conduit
## The Connector
Favored Attribute: Network

> *The city is the greatest marketplace in the world for goods and information but without you, people wouldn't find each other to make such exchanges.*


## Moves

### Connector 
*(Improvement to Meet Someone New)*

When you **Meet Someone New**, in lieu of answering a question you may instead offer to facilitate an introduction to someone important to them.

### Smooth Talker
*(Improvement to Negotiate)*

When you **Negotiate**, they pick two Weak Responses.

### Create a Diversion
When you spread a rumor to create a distraction after you **Reveal a Secret**, roll +Network. On a hit, you may avoid marking Heat. On a 10+, you may limit the Reactions they can pick from: offer them two.

### Know Someone
When you need someone in your current neighborhood with a particular skill, expertise, or knowledge, roll +Network.
If you have a connection to the neighborhood, roll with advantage.
On a hit, you know where to find them. On a 7-9, pick 1.
- They're not at home when you get there.
- They don't remember you.
- Their expertise has been compromised.
- They need convincing to help you.

### Trade Tongue
You speak a local dialect specific to trading or commerce. Pick two descriptors for the dialect. When you **Observe Someone**, you may freely ask, "Do they speak the Trade Tongue?" When interacting with someone who speaks the Trade Tongue, roll with advantage.

**Descriptors**
- Secret (people don't know about it)
- Hidden (it may be used without others easily recognizing it)
- Incomplete (it covers only rudimentary trading or commercial concepts)
- Offensive (if they hear it, they judge you harshly)
- Proximity (it requires speakers to be a certain distance from each other)

## Ties & Secrets
Pick two people with whom you have a Tie. For each, pick what you know about them from the [[Lists#Area of Insight]]

- Tolith, an information broker
- Virion, a younger relative
- Sylmar, a former lover
- Kendel, a confidant
- Aelrin, a high ranked customer
