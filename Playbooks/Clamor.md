# Clamor
## The Dabbler
Favored Attribute: Lore

> *The city is your laboratory, and you study everything that comes through it -- a dilettante whose curiosity is matched only by your persistence.*

## Moves

### Perceptive 
*(Improvement to Appraise Circumstances)*

When you **Appraise Circumstances** involving a faction or a neighborhood, on a hit you may rewrite one of the target's tags.

### Open to New Experiences 
*(Improvement to Sample the Sights & Sounds)*

When you **Sample the Sights and Sounds**, you may clear 2 Heat when you pick a Reaction.


### I've Studied Your Kind
When you **Meet Someone New**, you may roll with Lore instead of Network.


### Generalist
When you recall an obscure fact or bit of trivia, roll +Lore. On a hit, the information is correct and relevant. Take +1 forward to the next move using that information. On 7-9, pick one compromise.

**Compromises**
- You're missing one key detail.
- You got one small piece of the information wrong.
- You remember an important part of the information too late.
- You mixed up two aspects of the information.


### Laboratory
Note on the map where the laboratory is, and pick two aspects that describe it:
- Secret
- Shared
- Unsafe
- Remote
- Ill-Equipped
- Infested

When you conduct an experiment or do research or build something in your laboratory, **write a belief** about your work and roll +Aspects (lower is better). On a hit, the belief is challenged -- mark it. On 10+, pick a consequence.

You may spend 2 Assets to remove one aspect from the laboratory.

**Consequences**
- The work has a temporary effect on you
- Add the aspect Damaged to your laboratory
- Add another aspect to your laboratory
- Mark Heat

### Inquisitive
When you **Use Power** to see clearly or reveal hidden things, roll with +2.

## Ties & Secrets
Pick two people with whom you have a Tie. For each, pick what you know about them from the [[Lists#Area of Insight]]
- Fritz, a former colleague
- Toula, a rival
- Wiley, a supplier
- Harvet, a patron
- Sarle, a government official

## Recuperation
- You may always clear 1 Heat when you lay low for a day. Ask the Magistrate what you missed.
- When you come upon an interesting mystery in the city, clear one Heat.
- When you share an intimate moment with someone and you can observe the beauty of the city without studying it, clear 1 Heat.
