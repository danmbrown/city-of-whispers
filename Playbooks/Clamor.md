# Clamor
Favored Attribute: Lore

> *The city is your laboratory, and you study everything that comes through it -- a dilettante whose curiosity is matched only by your persistence.*

## Moves

### Perceptive 
*(Improvement to Appraise Circumstances)*

When you Appraise Circumstances involving a faction or a neighborhood, on a hit you may rewrite one of the target's tags.

### Inquisitive 
*(Improvement to Sample the Sights & Sounds)*

### Like the Back of Your Hand 
*(Alternate Attribute)*

When you Get Your Bearings, you may roll with Lore instead of Environs.

### Generalist
When you recall an obscure fact or bit of trivia, roll +Lore. On a hit, the information is correct and relevant. Take +1 forward to the next move using that information. On 7-9, pick one compromise.

**Compromises**
- You're missing one key detail.
- You got one small piece of the information wrong.
- You remember an important part of the information too late.
- You mixed up two aspects of the information.


#### Laboratory
Note on the map where the laboratory is, and pick two aspects that describe it:
- Secret
- Shared
- Unsafe
- Remote
- Ill-Equipped

When you conduct an experiment or do research or build something in your laboratory, add a fact about your work and roll +Aspects. On a hit, the fact is, in fact, not true. On 10+, pick a consequence.

**Consequences**
- The work has a temporary effect on you
- Add the aspect Damaged to your laboratory
- Mark Heat
