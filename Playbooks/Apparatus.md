#### The Big Picture


#### Informants
You have a network of people who provide useful information on the goings on of the city. When you use a move that gains information (Appraise Circumstances, Get Something, or Observe Someone) you may mark your Informants as if marking a History or Demand. When you do, describe the informant and increase your result by one tier. Every time you mark an Informant, roll -Informants marked. On a hit, you don't raise any suspicion. On a 10+, you may clear one mark. You may reset the informants marks by spending one resource.
