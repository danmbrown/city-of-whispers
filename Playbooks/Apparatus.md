# Apparatus
## The Sustainer

Favored Attribute: Lore

>*The city is a great machine, an intricate connection of cogs and wheels ever ticking through infinite calculations. But every machine, even the great ones, need occasional winding, lubricating, and de-bugging.*

## Map Elements
In your first session, add an element to the map that represents the city's bureaucracy or complex interrelationships. Here are some ideas:

- A marketplace
- A university
- A port
- A government building
- A meeting location for crime families

At any time, you may mark Heat to add another element to the map.

## Relationship Questions
First, ask the table one of these questions: 

* Which of you doesn't trust my skill in my area of expertise?
* Which of you relied on me to help them out of a jam related to my expertise?

Then, ask the table one of these questions:

- Who among your connections keeps me informed about part of the city?
- Who among your connections thinks I'm up to no good?


## Moves

### Municipal Works Expertise (Required)
You have some deep knowledge about the city's inner workings and infrastructure. Pick one area of expertise. When you apply your knowledge, you may roll the move with Lore in place of its usual attribute. When you **Appraise Circumstances** or put your **Ear to the Ground**, you may roll with advantage.

- Transportation
- Sanitation and Waste
- Rule-Making Bureaucracy
- Regulatory Bureaucracy
- Civil Engineering
- Public Health
- Law Enforcement
- Finance
- Social Services


### Shortcut
*(Improvement to Transit)*

You know shortcuts through the city. When you **Transit**, you may pick a Consequence to get to your destination without rolling.

### Observe Problems
*(Improvement to Get Your Bearings)*

When you **Get Your Bearings**, you may always ask one of the questions from the **Appraise Circumstances** list.

### Old City Knowledge
You are familiar with previous incarnations of the city. **Write a belief** about an older version of the city. When this belief is proven wrong, you may immediately replace it with another.

### Crew (Group)
You manage or work with a crew responsible for the Municipal Works. Their responsibility matches your Municipal Works Expertise. Identify their territory (3 adjacent neighborhoods). When you call on your crew to provide support, describe what you need them to do to help you out. You may take +1 forward if it's in their territory and +1 forward if it aligns with their expertise. Otherwise, mark 1 Heat to get +1 to your roll.

### Tune the Machine
When you **Use Power** to locate objects, landmarks, or people, roll with +2.

## Connections
Pick two people with whom you have a connection. For each, pick what you know about them from the [[Lists#Secrets]]

- Thirrik, a corrupt colleague
- Kymil, a former apprentice
- Hokula, a city skulk
- Aruna, a cousin from the other side of town
- Mazoth, the city's renowned barista

## Recuperation
- You may always clear 1 Heat when you lay low for a day. Ask the Magistrate what you missed.
- When you use your knowledge of the city's infrastructure, clear one Heat.
- When you share an intimate moment with someone and talk about life beyond the city, clear 1 Heat.
