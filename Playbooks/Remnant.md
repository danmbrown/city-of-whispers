# Remnant
## The Discards
Favored Attribute: Environs

>*If the city is a giant living thing then you are its waste -- its sweat, its tears, and its ordure. You are a byproduct of its greatest efforts, but also essential to its ongoing health.*

## Map Elements
In your first session, add an element to the map that represent what's unwanted or undesirable. Here are some ideas:

- A dump
- A sewer system
- A slum
- The waste of a dangerous substance
- Abandoned housing, destroyed after a disaster

At any time, you may mark Heat to add another element to the map.

## Relationship Questions
* Who sees me as a threat?
* With whom did I experience a dangerous situation?
* Who is considered "part of the family"?

## Moves

### Shortcut
You know five Shortcuts through the city. When you Transit, you may mark a Shortcut instead of marking Heat or instead of marking a History or Demand to bump a roll. When you use a Shortcut, you may take a connection to the destination neighborhood.

### Urban Camouflage
When you blend into your surroundings or hope to avoid notice (even as a consequence of a prior move), roll +Environs. If you have a connection with the neighborhood, you may roll with advantage.

- **10+** You avoid detection. Mark Heat to ensure there is no lingering suspicion.
- **7-9** You avoid detection, but you end up in a difficult position, or must make a hard choice. The Magistrate will tell you what. 


### Bonus Tie
Your outcast state allows you to snoop through other people's business. You start with a third Tie and you know a secret about them, but they do not know you. Whenever you Use a Secret about this Tie, the secret is only revealed when any of the dice shows a 1.

### Recruited
You were drawn into a gang, working for a local boss. You have access to the gang's resources, a track with three boxes. Whenever you have to mark Heat, you may instead mark one of the Gang's boxes. When you do, roll -Gang (number of boxes marked). On a hit, you fly under the radar. On 10+, you may clear one mark on Gang. On a miss, the boss will insist you do a job for them. If you complete it to their satisfaction, you may reset the Gang track. If you've filled the Gang track, you may introduce a gang-related request or complication into the story to clear the track.

### Dregs (Group)
You run with a group of other outcasts. When you stir them to action with your words or deeds, mark Heat and roll +Environs. On a hit, they do what you ask so long as they don't expose themselves to harm. They pick one consequence. On a 10+, you may eliminate one consequence before they pick.

-   They leave things unfinished or in a risky position
-   They take things too far
-   They demand you reveal a secret about yourself
-   They expect a favor in return
-   They do something for themselves, too
