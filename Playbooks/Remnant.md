# Remnant
Favored Attribute: Environs

> *The city is a maelstrom to the senses, utterly foreign to you in its ways and norms and traditions.*

## Moves

### Distinct Group (Required)
In addition to your faction, you belong to another group representing a distinct ethnicity, religion, creed, or culture. Create this group the same way you create a faction. One of the aspects of the group must highlight how it is different from the majority culture of the city. Pick one connection to the city:

- **Custom**: Something about your group -- an article of clothing, a type of food, an art form -- long ago became popular in the city. Over time the city appropriated it as a signature touchstone. What is it? 
- **Enclave**: There is a neighborhood dedicated to your group, and its name is a play on your group's name. Where is it? What is distinctive about it?
- **Slang**: Words from your group's original language have made their way into the local dialect. What common word originated in your group's language?

### Safe House
When you **Steer Clear** in a neighborhood controlled by your group, you may roll with advantage.

If in a neighborhood controlled by any other group, you may instead mark Heat to enter a building that's protected by someone from yours.

### Finding Friends
*(Improvement to Observe Someone)*

When you **Observe Someone**, you may always ask, "Are they an ally?"

### 
*(Improvement to Meet Someone New)*

When you **Meet Someone New**, you may pick "You are from the same group" as a Shared Experience. If you do, you do not need to answer any questions.
