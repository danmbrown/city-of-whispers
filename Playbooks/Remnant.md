## The Discards
Favored Attribute: Environs

>*If the city is a giant living thing then you are its waste -- its sweat, its tears, and its ordure. You are a byproduct of its greatest efforts, but also essential to its ongoing health.*

## Moves

### Shortcut
You know five Shortcuts through the city. When you Transit, you may mark a Shortcut instead of marking Heat or instead of marking a History or Demand to bump a roll. When you use a Shortcut, you may take a connection to the destination neighborhood.

### Urban Camouflage
When you blend into your surroundings or hope to avoid notice (even as a consequence of a prior move), roll +Environs. If you have a connection with the neighborhood, you may roll with advantage.

### Bonus Tie
Your outcast state allows you to snoop through other people's business. You start with a third Tie and you know a secret about them, but they do not know you. Whenever you Use a Secret about this Tie, the secret is only revealed when any of the dice shows a 1.
