*(Improvement to Observe Someone)*

- "What gets your attention?"

### Irresistible Offer
*(Alternate Attribute)*

When you Get Something, you may roll with Sway instead of Network.

When you perform for someone describe what it looks like, mark a Shtick and make your next roll involving that person with advantage.

### Den of Amusement
You own, run, or manage a club where people go to relax or escape. Where is it located? What does it serve? What is the clientele like? You have a scheme with Productivity +1.

When you **Meet Someone New**, you may add "They are a customer" to the list of Shared Experiences. If you pick this, you may also add them as a Tie.

Select one drawback:

**Drawbacks**
- Extortion -- Need to pay someone off (spend one asset before you Run the Scheme)
- Limited Labor (productivity maxes out at +1)
- Contraband (cross off one of the options under Use Asset)

### Entourage
You are surrounded by supporters, fans, frequent patrons, and others who hold you in high esteem, or think they can get something from you. Pick one Passion for the group and start it at Zeal 0. After a roll, you may engage their help. Describe how they help you and roll with Zeal. On a hit, you may bump the result one tier. On a 7-9, lower Zeal by 1.
Whenever you like, but no more than once per session, you may indulge the entourage's passion to increase Zeal.

**Passions**
- Things: Spend 2 Assets to increase Zeal
- Thrills: Mark 2 Heat to increase Zeal
- Gossip: Reveal a Secret to increase Zeal

If Zeal gets to -3, your entourage needs a new passion. Reset Zeal to 0, and select a new Passion.
If Zeal gets to +3, your entourage starts attracting unwanted attention. Mark 2 heat to lower the Zeal to 0.
