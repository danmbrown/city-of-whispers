## CATS
* **Concept**: In City of Whispers, you play the denizens of a fantasy city, pulsing with magical and technological power, rife with intrigue, and teetering against the backdrop of global strife. Factions compete for resources and influence and territory. Individuals strive to gain ever-increasing control over the city itself. 
* **Aim**: Over the course of several sessions, you and the other players will collaborate to describe the schemes and plots your characters are involved with. You'll gradually reveal an overarching conspiracy, identifying the non-player characters who are involved, those who are scapegoats, and those who are driving the whole machine. In each session, you'll zoom out to describe changes in the political landscape relative to your characters' factions. In addition to tracking changes to your character in the character keeper, you will maintain a map of the city's neighborhoods and landmarks, and a diagram capturing the relationships between the main characters.
* **Tone**: Intrigue is at the heart of City of Whispers. The palette centers on noir elements, as well as political thrillers and courtly drama. The characters mistrust the NPCs to a greater or lesser extend, and their trust in each other is tenuous at best. A haze of unease pervades the story, as if at any moment the fortunes of a faction might turn. They place greater stock in secrets and information than they do in coin. Playing in the city's political realm involves a certain amount of danger to both one's reputation and one's person. It almost invariably involves interacting with the city's seedier side, making the tone noir: grim and tense.
* **Subject**: The city, while a backdrop for the characters' stories, is also a central figure. The game treats the city as a living, breathing, eating, defecating entity, exerting its will, regardless of how it interferes with the characters' schemes. The stories therefore will deal with the turmoil of living in a vibrant, diverse city, and might venture into politics, justice, romance, betrayal, to name a few.

## Table Manners
City of Whispers has no opinion on whether the characters work collaboratively or not. While they should avoid being directly competitive or confrontational, each may work toward their own ends, leaning on others to suit their needs. But while the characters may treat each other with little regard to their well-being, the players at the table should be respectful and supportive. Here are the behaviors I like to see at my tables:

* Gentle reminders: Sometimes people forget rules or cross a line or a veil. Generally speaking, their enthusiasm for the game carried them away. If you notice something, offer a gentle reminder. 
* Check-ins: Everyone should be able to offer ideas to each other, but instead of dictating
* Breaks:
