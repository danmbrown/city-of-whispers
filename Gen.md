# Getting Started

## Establish the Contours of the City
*The heart of the game is the map of the city. Throughout the game you'll add to the map. To get started, the group will add some key neighborhoods and landmarks.*

Take a [**city map template**](city-of-whispers-map-templates.pdf) and add one of the listed elements. Cross out the element and pass the page to the next player. After everyone has taken a turn with the map, pass the paper around one more time so players may optionally add another element.
 
## Determine the Backdrop *(Optional)*
*The backdrop establishes the overarching events or circumstances. The characters may be embroiled in these events, or they may simply feel the repercussions of them.*

Roll for or select options on the [**backdrop table**](Lists.md#backdrops) to determine what's going on in the world and in the city at large. Discuss the basic sketch the table gives you to create a more fleshed out story. Do not sweat the details too much at this stage.

Consider adding an element or two to the map related to the backdrop. For example, if the backdrop calls for a `waning magical invasion` the group could add locations where the invasion was most prevalent.
 
## Select Playbooks
*The playbooks each represent a different type of city denizen, with an emphasis on how they contribute to the city as a complex animate organism. No playbook prescribes an occupation. Instead, the character's occupation or trade or lifestyle is a function of how they are integrated into the city's ecosystem.*

Review the **[playbooks](Playbooks/Overview.md)** and select one. Every player should have a different playbook. 

Make note of the playbook's favored attribute, and then assign your **[attribute scores](Characters.md#Attributes)** based on one of these arrays:  

- +2, +1, 0, -1
- +1, +1, +1, -1
- +2, +2, -1, -1
- +2, +1, +1, -2
- +2, +2, 0, -2
 
## Select Starting Moves and Power
Pick two **starting moves** from your playbook. Some playbooks have a required starting move, which must be one of your two starting moves.

Select your character's **[power](Characters.md#Power)**, and set the maximum complexity to 0.

## Update the Map: Characters
Go around the table and add a detail to the map based on your character's concept. Make up whatever detail you like, but the playbook has some ideas to get you going.

## Create Factions *(Optional)*
Determine what faction your character belongs to by rolling from or selecting from the [**factions tables**](Lists.md#factions).

## Update the Map: Factions *(Optional)*
Go around the table and select a neighborhood to be your faction's base of operations, and add a detail to the map related to your faction.

## Write Beliefs and Secrets
Your character starts with **two beliefs** and **two Ties**.

Beliefs capture a fundamental understanding you have about the world and the people in it. They may be true, and if you rely on them too much you may  find out they're not. You can write the beliefs on your own, or use the [**beliefs tables**](Lists.md#beliefs) to inspire you.

Ties are people that you know something about. When interacting with others, you can use the secret for leverage, but you may reveal the secret, and then face the consequences. Select the Ties from your playbook, and then select or roll for what [**secrets**](Lists.md#secrets) you have about the Tie.

## Introduce Yourselves and Determine Relationships
Go around the table and introduce your character.

When introducing your character be sure to include:

- Your character's name and pronouns
- The overarching concept, if any
- Their beliefs
- Their ties
- Their starting moves

As you introduce your characters, the Magistrate can start the **relationship map** to capture the relationships between the PCs and their ties.

Also, make note of any **updates to the map implied by playbook moves**. Before you ask the relationship questions, add these elements to the map.

Then, go around the table again and ask two of your Relationship questions. As players provide responses, the Magistrate should add to the relationship map, illustrating the connections between the characters.
