# Getting Started

## Establish the Contours of the City
Take a city map template and add one of the listed elements. Cross out the element and pass the page to the next player. After everyone has taken a turn with the map, pass the paper around one more time so players may optionally add another element.
 
## Determine the Backdrop
*Optional*
Roll for or select options on the [**backdrop table**](Lists.md#backdrops) to determine what's going on in the world and in the city at large. Discuss the basic sketch the table gives you to create a more fleshed out story. Do not sweat the details too much at this stage.
 
## Select Playbooks
Review the playbooks and select one. Every player should have a different playbook. 

Make note of the playbook's favored attribute, and then assign your attribute scores based on one of these arrays:  

- +2, +1, 0, -1
- +2, +1, 0, -1
- +1, +1, +1, -2
- +1, +1, 0 ,0
- +2, +2, -1, -1
 
## Select Starting Moves and Power
Pick two starting moves from your playbook.

Select your character's power, and set the maximum complexity to 0.

## Update the Map
Go around the table and add a detail to the map based on your character's concept. Make up whatever detail you like, but the playbook has some ideas to get you going.

## Create Factions
Determine what faction your character belongs to by rolling from or selecting from the [**factions tables**](Lists.md#factions).

## Update the Map
Go around the table and select a neighborhood to be your faction's base of operations.

Then go around the table again and add a detail to the map related to your faction.

## Write Beliefs and Select Ties
Your character starts with two beliefs and two Ties.

You can write the beliefs on your own, or use the [**beliefs tables**](Lists.md#beliefs) to inspire you.

Select the Ties from your playbook, and then select or roll for what [**area of insight**](Lists.md#secrets) you have about the Tie.

## Introduce Yourselves and Determine Relationships
