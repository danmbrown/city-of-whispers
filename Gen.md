# Getting Started

## Establish the Contours of the City
Take a city map template and add one of the listed elements. Cross out the element and pass the page to the next player. After everyone has taken a turn with the map, pass the paper around one more time so players may optionally add another element.
 
## Determine the Backdrop
*Optional*
Roll for or select options on the [**backdrop table**](Lists.md#backdrops) to determine what's going on in the world and in the city at large. Discuss the basic sketch the table gives you to create a more fleshed out story. Do not sweat the details too much at this stage.
 
## Select Playbooks
Review the playbooks and select one. Every player should have a different playbook. 

Make note of the playbook's favored attribute, and then assign your attribute scores based on one of these arrays:  

- +2, +1, 0, -1
- +2, +1, 0, -1
- +1, +1, +1, -2
- +1, +1, 0 ,0
- +2, +2, -1, -1
 
## Select Starting Moves and Power
Pick two starting moves from your playbook.

Select your character's power, and set the maximum complexity to 0.

## Update the Map
Go around the table and add a detail to the map based on your character's concept. Make up whatever detail you like, but the playbook has some ideas to get you going.

## Create Factions
Determine what faction your character belongs to by rolling from or selecting from the [**factions tables**](Lists.md#factions).

## Update the Map
Go around the table and select a neighborhood to be your faction's base of operations.

Then go around the table again and add a detail to the map related to your faction.

## Write Beliefs and Secrets
Your character starts with two beliefs and two Ties.

Beliefs capture a fundamental understanding you have about the world and the people in it. They may be true, and if you rely on them too much you may  find out they're not. You can write the beliefs on your own, or use the [**beliefs tables**](Lists.md#beliefs) to inspire you.

Ties are people that you know something about. When interacting with others, you can use the secret for leverage, but you may reveal the secret, and then face the consequences. Select the Ties from your playbook, and then select or roll for what [**secrets**](Lists.md#secrets) you have about the Tie.

## Introduce Yourselves and Determine Relationships
Go around the table and introduce your character.

Then, go around the table again and ask two of your Relationship questions. As players provide responses, the Magistrate should create a relationship map that illustrates the connections between the characters.
