# The Characters
## Attributes
- **Environs**: Your comfort with the geographical contours of the city
- **Lore**: Your knowledge of the city's culture, history, and infrastructure
- **Network**: Your connections throughout the city
- **Sway**: Your ability to engage and influence individuals

## Heat
Your character generates Heat by taking risky actions during the game. When a move or the Magistrate directs you to mark Heat, mark one of the options on the Heat list. As long as this is marked, your character suffers the mechanical consequence indicated.

In addition to a mechanical impact, marking Heat should influence the direction of the narrative as well. When you mark Heat, the Magistrate will indicate how the increased pressure or suspicion changes the story.

When directed to roll -Heat, subtract the total number of Heat marked from your roll.

- Pressure from Rivals: If you roll a 1 on either die any move, the Magistrate introduces an additional complication
- Pressure from Superiors: Roll with disadvantage on Playbook Moves
- Suspicion of Friends: Roll with disadvantage on City Moves
- Suspicion of Authorities: Roll with disadvantage on Risky Moves

## Power
Every character has the ability to tap into a source of power. Upon generating your character, determine which type of power they can use and how that manifests in your city.

> When you apply your connection with magic, deity, or technology, the Magistrate determines the complexity of your desired outcome. So long as it is lower than your maximum complexity, you can Use Power. Every application of mysterious energy comes with a price. Nearly every time you use it, there will be consequences, and perhaps the occasional Backfire.

**Areas of Power**
- Arcane Technology: Magic-infused mechanisms
- Divine Devotion: Invoking the divine power of one or more gods
- Planar Sorcery: Drawing power from other planes of existence
- Occult Connection: Deep knowledge of the mystic arts
- Natural Harmony: Attuned to the cycles of life and death
- Elemental Link: Tapped into the buried energies of earth, air, fire, and water
- Enchanted Artifacts: Affinity for objects imbued with occult power
- Mechanical Technology: Aptitude for gadgets and devices

## Ties and Secrets
If the trade of goods, services, and information is the city's lifeblood, then its soul is the connections between people. Your character's connections are represented by their Network attribute, but they also have Ties to specific individuals. A Tie is a person who holds a unique place in the character's life, whether they are known intimately to each other. Your character knows something about their Ties, a secret that can give them a bit of leverage or help them out of a bind.

Secrets are defined by Areas of Insight -- the aspect of the Tie's life that you know something about.

> During the course of the game, you may Use a Secret to roll with advantage on social interaction moves. Roll a 1 or a 2, however, and you Reveal a Secret, which could have disastrous consequences.

**Areas of Insight**
- Romantic liaisons
- Family circumstances
- Criminal connections
- Professional dealings
- Political alliances
- Immoral activities
- Illicit past
- Vices
- Beliefs outside mainstream
- Corrupt influences

## Beliefs
Characters have beliefs about themselves, the city, and the people in it that influences their worldview and behaviors. Conviction gives characters confidence, but relying too much on belief -- rather than perception or wit or reason -- can backfire. Events that challenge a characters belief can shake their conviction, and may eventually prove false.

> When you Use a Belief, you can roll with advantage. But rolling a 1 or a 2 will challenge your conviction.

## Deals
Throughout the course of the story, your character might strike a deal with another city denizen. There is space on the character keeper to track these deals, so that you (or the Magistrate) may cash in on them (perhaps when you least expect it). 

> Deals have no mechanical impact on the game.

## Schemes
Stay in the city long enough and you'll set up a scheme for generating a bit of income or producing useful resources.

> Schemes are measured by their Productivity. They produce Assets, currency you can spend to grease the wheels in your favor.


## Neighborhood Connections
Surroundings define a person as much as their personality or family history. A person in a new neighborhood or among strangers does not have the confidence they do in familiar environs. Every character starts out with a connection to a neighborhood in the city. Throughout the game, however, you will forge connections to additional neighborhoods through flashbacks.

> Some moves indicate that having a neighborhood connection lets you roll with advantage or some other bonus.

**Histories**
You may mark these in any order.

Narrate a flashback showing how in this neighborhood you...
- learned a valuable life lesson
- lost something important, valuable, or sentimental
- sought comfort or refuge from something dangerous
- fell into or out of love

**Demands**
These must be marked in order. You may not mark a Demand until you have fulfilled the previous one. When you mark the last one, the city has taken too much from you, and your character must retire.

Describe what the city demands that you do to... 
- fortify something weakened in this neighborhood
- replace something missing in this neighborhood
- build something new in this neighborhood
- remove something ailing this neighborhood
