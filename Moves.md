>
> The player rolls three dice and gets a 1 + 4 + 5. This gives Miabella a 9 on the **Negotiate** move, but the secret is revealed. According to the **Reveal a Secret** move, Miabella loses the Tie with Donatella.
>
> The Magistrate gets to pick two Reactions for Donatella. From Negotiate, Donatella selects *Demand more compensation* and from  Reveal a Secret, Donatella selects *They deny the truth, leaving you in doubt*.
